# Summer Chores Callback Simulation

## Project Description

This project simulates completing a list of summer chores using JavaScript callbacks. Each chore takes arbitrarily selected values, in milliseconds, used to simulate task duration. After each chore, aside from the first of the day, there is a chance te eperson may fall asleep. I have increased the probability after each chore to simulate real-world fatigue throughout the day. 

The project is an exercise in asynchronous JavaScript functions using "setTimeout" and callbacks.

## Concepts Practiced

- JavaScript callbacks
- Asynchronous programming
- setTimeout()
- Math.random()
- Conditional if/else logic
- Callback wrapping

---

## Tech Used
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub

---

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open project folder
3. Run command:

```bash
node callbackVersion.js
```
The program currently runs using a pre-appointed string literal name. You can change the name directly inside the doSummerChores() function call if you wish, just have fun. 🙃
